## :warning: Tech/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Caffe-based face detector](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## :star: Features
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, it’s also computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download]()

This dataset consists of __3835 images__ belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1916 images__
*	__without_mask: 1919 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Bing Search API__ ([See Python script](https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection/search.py))
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection.git/requirements.txt)

## 🚀&nbsp; Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'
```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory folder and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command: 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
## :key: Results
