## :warning: Tech/framework used

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [Caffe-based face detector](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/)
- [Keras](https://keras.io/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [MobileNetV2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## :star: Features
Our face mask detector didn't use any morphed masked images dataset. The model is accurate, and since we used the MobileNetV2 architecture, itâ€™s alsoÂ computationally efficient and thus making it easier to deploy the model to embedded systems (Raspberry Pi, Google Coral, etc.).

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

## :file_folder: Dataset
The dataset used can be downloaded here - [Click to Download]()

This dataset consists ofÂ __3835 images__Â belonging to two classes:
*	__with_mask: 1916 images__
*	__without_mask: 1919 images__

The images used were real images of faces wearing masks. The images were collected from the following sources:

* __Bing Search API__ ([See Python script](https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection/search.py))
* __Kaggle datasets__ 
* __RMFD dataset__ ([See here](https://github.com/X-zhangyang/Real-World-Masked-Face-Dataset))

## :key: Prerequisites

All the dependencies and required libraries are included in the file <code>requirements.txt</code> [See here](https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection.git/requirements.txt)

## ðŸš€&nbsp; Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/rajsinha77/Face-Recognition/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

2. Change your directory to the cloned repo and create a Python virtual environment named 'test'
```
$ mkvirtualenv test
```

3. Now, run the following command in your Terminal/Command Prompt to install the libraries required
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## :bulb: Working

1. Open terminal. Go into the cloned project directory folder and type the following command:
```
$ python3 train_mask_detector.py --dataset dataset
```

2. To detect face masks in an image type the following command: 
```
$ python3 detect_mask_image.py --image images/pic1.jpeg
```

3. To detect face masks in real-time video streams type the following command:
```
$ python3 detect_mask_video.py 
```
## :key: Results
